        **Act as an expert Website Content Strategist and SEO Analyst.**

        Your task is to analyze the provided data about a website's content structure and topical relevance. Your audience is the **website owner**, who may not be an SEO expert. Therefore, your explanation must be **clear, concise, and easy to understand**, avoiding overly technical jargon whenever possible. If technical terms are necessary, explain them simply.

        **Your goal is to provide a comprehensive summary that includes:**
        1.  An explanation of the key metrics (Focus Score, Radius Score).
        2.  Insights derived from the data (what the scores and URL examples mean for *this specific site*).
        3.  A practical, actionable plan the site owner can follow.

        **DATA FOR ANALYSIS:**

        *   **Total URLs Analyzed:** {total_urls}
            *   *This is the number of pages on the site included in this analysis.*

        *   **Site Focus Score:** {focus_score:.2f} / 100
            *   *Explanation: This score measures how tightly connected your site's content is to a central theme. A higher score (closer to 100) means your content is very consistent and focused on a specific topic or niche. A lower score suggests the content might be scattered across different, less related topics.*

        *   **Site Radius Score:** {radius_score:.2f} / 100
            *   *Explanation: This score indicates the breadth or range of topics covered on your site, relative to the main theme. A higher score suggests your site explores a wider variety of related sub-topics. A lower score means the site sticks very closely to the core topic with less variation.*

        *   **Most Focused URLs (Examples closest to the site's core theme):**
            {format_url_list(top_focused_urls)}
            *   *Insight: These pages likely represent the very heart of what your website is about.*

        *   **Most Divergent URLs (Examples furthest from the site's core theme):**
            {format_url_list(top_divergent_urls)}
            *   *Insight: These pages are the least related to your site's main topic. They might be necessary (like 'Contact Us') or could indicate content that's off-topic.*
        """

        if page_type_distribution:
            prompt += "\n*   **Page Type Distribution (How content is categorized):**\n"
            for page_type, count in page_type_distribution.items():
                percentage = (count / total_urls) * 100 if total_urls > 0 else 0
                prompt += f"    - {page_type}: {count} pages ({percentage:.1f}%)\n"
            prompt += "    *   *Insight: This shows the balance of different types of content (e.g., products, blog posts, informational pages) on your site.*\n"
        # Optional: Add cluster info if available

        **ANALYSIS AND ACTION PLAN REQUIRED:**

        Please provide the analysis **strictly following the structure below**. Do not add any introductory sentences before section 1 or concluding remarks after section 3.

        **1. Executive Summary (Understand Your Site's Topical Health):**
            *   Start with a simple, high-level sentence summarizing the site's overall topical focus and breadth based on the scores.
            *   Explain what the **Site Focus Score ({focus_score:.2f})** specifically means for *this* website in plain English. Is the content tightly knit or more varied?
            *   Explain what the **Site Radius Score ({radius_score:.2f})** specifically means for *this* website. Does it cover a wide range of related subjects, or is it narrowly specialized?
            *   Briefly describe how the focus and radius scores work together for this site (e.g., "Highly focused on a narrow topic," "Covers a broad area but stays well-connected," "Seems a bit scattered across different themes").

        **2. Key Insights from Your Content:**
            *   Based on the **Most Focused URLs**, what appears to be the core subject matter or purpose of this website?
            *   What do the **Most Divergent URLs** suggest? Are these expected outliers (like 'About Us', 'Privacy Policy'), or do they represent content potentially diluting the site's focus? Could they be opportunities to link back to core topics?
            *   (If Page Type Distribution provided) How does the mix of page types relate to the focus and radius scores? Does the distribution support the site's apparent goals (e.g., lots of product pages for an e-commerce site, lots of blog posts for an informational site)?

        **3. Action Plan (Steps to Improve or Maintain Focus):**
            *   Provide **2-4 specific, actionable recommendations** based *directly* on the data analysis above.
            *   For each recommendation, clearly state **what** the site owner should do and **why** it's suggested based on the scores or URL examples (e.g., "Recommendation: Strengthen internal links from [Divergent URL example type] back to core [Focused URL example type] pages. Why: This can help tie potentially stray content back to your main theme, improving overall focus.").
            *   Phrase recommendations as clear steps (e.g., "Review content on divergent pages...", "Consider creating new content on sub-topics related to...", "Audit internal linking between...").
            *   Ensure the recommendations are practical for a typical website owner.

        **IMPORTANT:**
        *   Use straightforward language. Pretend you are explaining this directly to the business owner over coffee.
        *   Base your entire analysis *strictly* on the data provided. Do not invent information or assume external context.
        *   The goal is to be helpful, insightful, and provide clear direction.
        *   Deliver ONLY the structured analysis requested (Sections 1, 2, and 3). Omit any conversational opening (like "Okay, here is the analysis...") or closing remarks (like "I hope this helps...").**
