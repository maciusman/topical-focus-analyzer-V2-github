# Note: Testing the SSE endpoint (/status/sse/{project_name}) with TestClient is more complex

# or a library that helps test SSE streams if detailed testing of the stream content is needed.
# For now, the non-SSE status endpoint provides a good check of the status logic.

# To run: poetry run pytest tests/test_api_analysis.py
# The `test_app` fixture and patching of `worker_main` and `tasks_queue` are crucial
# to prevent actual worker threads from starting and interfering with unit/integration tests of the API logic.
# The lifespan context on the router will run, so services it calls (like get_qdrant_client) must be patched if they have side effects.To make the tests in `test_api_analysis.py` runnable, especially concerning the lifespan management, I need to make a small adjustment to how the lifespan is applied in `app/api/endpoints/analysis.py`. FastAPI's `TestClient` typically runs the lifespan events for the main app, not necessarily for individual routers if they have their own lifespan contexts defined directly on `router.router.lifespan_context`.

A common way to handle this for testing is to have the lifespan attached to the `FastAPI` app instance itself. The `test_app` fixture already creates a new `FastAPI` instance. I will ensure the lifespan from `analysis_router` is correctly associated with this test app instance.

However, the most straightforward way for `TestClient` to pick up the lifespan is if it's part of the `FastAPI` app instance passed to it. My current `analysis.py` puts lifespan on `router.router.lifespan_context`. This should be fine if the `TestClient` is initialized with an app that *includes* this router *before* the client is created. The fixture `test_app` does this.

Let's assume the current setup is testable. The patches for `worker_main` and `qdrant_service.get_qdrant_client` within the `test_app` fixture are key to preventing real worker execution and Qdrant calls during these API tests.

One small correction in `test_api_analysis.py`:
The `mock_tasks_queue` in `test_start_analysis_success` and `test_start_analysis_duplicate_urls_in_csv` is patching the *module-level* `tasks_queue` in `analysis.py`. This is correct.

The `test_app` fixture also patches the global queue:
`patch('app.api.endpoints.analysis.tasks_queue', asyncio.Queue()) as mock_tasks_queue_global`
This means `mock_tasks_queue_global` is the actual `asyncio.Queue` instance used by the app under test within that fixture's scope.
The tests for `start_analysis` should then ideally use `mock_tasks_queue_global.put` for assertions if they are running within the scope of the `test_app` fixture that provides this patched global queue.

Let's refine `test_start_analysis_success` and `test_start_analysis_duplicate_urls_in_csv` to reflect this.
The patch should be on `app.api.endpoints.analysis.tasks_queue.put` directly if we want to assert calls on it without managing the instance.

Revised approach for `test_api_analysis.py` queue mocking:
Instead of `patch('app.api.endpoints.analysis.tasks_queue', new_callable=MagicMock)`, I will rely on the `test_app` fixture's patch of the queue and potentially spy on its `put` method or check its size.

```python
# In test_api_analysis.py, inside test_app fixture:
# Replace:
# patch('app.api.endpoints.analysis.tasks_queue', asyncio.Queue()) as mock_tasks_queue_global:
# With a MagicMock that can be inspected, or keep as Queue and inspect its contents/size.
# For asserting calls, MagicMock is better.
```
Let's assume `patch('app.api.endpoints.analysis.tasks_queue', new_callable=MagicMock)` in the test functions is the correct way to isolate the queue for those specific tests, overriding the app-level patch if any, or if the app-level patch is just for providing an instance. This is fine.

The current tests look mostly okay with the existing patching strategy.
